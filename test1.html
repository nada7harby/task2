    <h4>What is the Anime?</h4>
    <p>
      Anime refers to a <b>specific</b> style of cartoon produced or inspired by
      Japanese <i>animation</i>. Think of it this way: all
      <mark>anime</mark> shows are cartoons, but not all <del>cartoons</del> are
      anime. The art style associated with anime is very unique and
      recognizable. You are probably <mark>familiar</mark> with the large eyes,
      wild hair, long arms and limbs, and more. This exaggerated design helps
      the characters more easily express emotions of which there are plenty in
      anime.
